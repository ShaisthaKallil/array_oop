In this program, Object Oriented Programming principles are applied

We take an array with predefined values and a value to group array values.
Add the group values inside array and find the largest sum
Also find the start index value from the original array from where we compute the largest group sum

EXAMPLE : myArray = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
          groupVal = 2
		  
		  //Result
		  Largest group sum : 11   // 5+6
		  Start Index : 4          //index of 5
